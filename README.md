Helm chart + Python app for a **time-series microservice** with built-in observability via **ELK** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).  

This repo demonstrates how to deploy a Python-based microservice on Kubernetes using Helm, with **sidecar-based log collection** using Filebeat, integrated into the ELK stack for **monitoring, troubleshooting, and visibility from Day 1**.

## üìä Observability Flow

1. The Python app writes logs to a **shared volume**.  
2. A **Filebeat sidecar container** (running inside the same pod) tails logs from this volume.  
3. Filebeat forwards logs to **Logstash** for processing.  
4. Logs are indexed in **Elasticsearch**.  
5. **Kibana** provides dashboards, search, and monitoring.

## üß© Sidecar Concept (Filebeat Integration)

- Each pod consists of **two containers**:  
  - The **app container** (Python microservice).  
  - A **Filebeat sidecar container**.  
- They share a `volumeMount` (e.g., `emptyDir{}`) where the app writes logs.  
- Filebeat tails the log files in that shared volume and ships them out.  

This ensures logs never leave the pod uncollected, and keeps observability consistent across microservices.

## üîé SRE Benefits (MTTD, MTTR, SLI/SLO)

This setup isn‚Äôt just about collecting logs ‚Äî it directly improves **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) metrics**:

- ‚è± **Reduced MTTD (Mean Time to Detect):**  
  Real-time log shipping and Kibana dashboards let you detect issues faster.  
- ‚ö° **Reduced MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery):**  
  Engineers can pinpoint failures (node, pod, or service-level) quickly and apply fixes.  
- üéØ **Better adherence to SLI/SLOs:**  
  Faster detection & recovery keeps error budgets safe and service reliability high.  
- üîÑ **Continuous feedback loop:**  
  Logs ‚Üí Insights ‚Üí Faster iteration ‚Üí Improved reliability.  

This makes the system **self-serving for both Dev and Ops teams**, ensuring observability drives reliability.

## ‚úÖ Benefits

- Observability baked in from **Day 1**.  
- Real-time insights into health, errors, and latency.  
- **Sidecar approach** keeps log collection tightly coupled with app lifecycle.  
- SRE-focused improvements in **MTTD, MTTR, and SLO adherence**.  
- Reusable Helm setup for other microservices.  
- Extensible: plug in Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, tracing, etc.
